## [Hidden Moss](1) & [Rug Pull Games](2)

Welcome to **Hidden Moss**, a game studio based in Chicago and Shanghai. Our team is passionate about creating engaging and immersive gaming experiences that challenge, entertain, and inspire players.

At Hidden Moss, we believe that games have the power to connect people across cultures, languages, and backgrounds. That's why we're dedicated to developing games that are accessible, inclusive, and diverse.

Our team brings together a diverse range of expertise, including game design, programming, art, and music. We're committed to working collaboratively to create games that push the boundaries of what's possible in the gaming industry.

We have two distinct brands under the Hidden Moss umbrella. Our indie game development branch, simply called **Hidden Moss**, focuses on creating unique and innovative games for a broad audience. On the other hand, our web3 game development brand, **Rug Pull Games**, is dedicated to exploring the potential of blockchain technology and NFTs to create exciting and decentralized gaming experiences.

Whether you're looking for the latest indie hit or the cutting edge of web3 gaming, we're excited to share our creations with you. Join us on our journey to create unforgettable gaming experiences that bring people together.
